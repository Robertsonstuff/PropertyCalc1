# PropertyCalc1
This is a simple python script to calculate rental yields. This script prompts you for: the Price of the property, expected rent of the property, Body Corporate (or strata), land tax and water rates.

I've also included a process to save your script in a .exe file format for ease of use. You'll need to activate your virtual environment and add a pyinstaller module - pip install pyinstaller - then copy the following script to create the .exe file format: 'pyinstaller -c -F Propertycalc.py'. Once this is created, this will create a 'dist' folder. You'll find your .exe file there! Just copy that file to your desktop and 'boomÂ¡!'. Now you'll have full functionality of your script without struggling to find the correct working directory and fumbling about with virtual environments. Super useful ay!?
