# PropertyCalc1
This is a simple python script to calculate rental yields in percentages from - at this stage - only 3 parameters. 1)Price of the property 2)expected rent of the property and 3)Body Corporate (or strata). I will be adding a more comprehensive rental calculator shortly - measuring more parameters - with a gui for usability.
